Firstly, before I get started with my experience, I would like to thank LetsGrowMore team for giving me this opportunity and enhace my skills.
LGM  is an online program designed to encourage student participation in open source software development,internships etc under the 
guidance of mentors.

I had applied for Web developer internship in LGM so that I can gain  some more experience in it. within few days I received a selection mail
from LGM. The internship started from 1 August 2021 so i decided to start doing the tasks that were provided.

The first task was to create a static web page with the help of HTML and CSS. This gave me the chance to use my skills, creativity to adjust
and algin various things on web page that will attract the users using various tags and cascading style sheets. Cascading Style Sheets 
is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML.

The second task was to create a web application using react app where I learnt about using react and sucessfully creating project using react.

My overall experience was amazing as i got chance to explore some new thing. The mentors  and the entire team of LGM and of these projects 
were helpful, they guided on how to do all those stuff and finally complete my work. The timing is flexible you can do your work whenever you are 
free without any interruption in other tasks.

I would like to participate in more events like this from LetsGrowMore in the future.
